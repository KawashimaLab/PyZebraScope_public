This is a repository for PyZebrascope, an open-source Python platform for brain-wide neural activity imaging in behaving zebrafish.

Light-sheet microscopy for whole-brain neural activity imaging in zebrafish requires specific features not available in commercially available microscopes. Such features include scanning of two orthogonal excitation beams and eye damage prevention. These specific requirements and the overwhelming number of device parameters that the users need to set during experiments were the main bottlenecks of everyday experiments and technology dissemination. PyZebrascope was developed to address this issue by taking advantage of other open-source microscopy projects such as Î¼Manager (https://micro-manager.org/) and other modules for device control, image processing, and machine learning.
